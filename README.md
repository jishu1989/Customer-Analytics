## Marketing Fundamentals

Before diving into Customer Analytics, its very important to understand basics of Marketing. Its important in marketing to know your customer well which is also termed as KYC(know your customer).
How products are marketed to consumers. Understanding the customer profiles, track behavior,predict their actions, taking actions to improve customer experience. So that they don't churn out and its possible for the company to retain their customers. 

### Marketing Framework:
One of the fundamental marketing framework is: **Segmentation --> Targeting --> Positioning**. Its also known as STP Framework.

**Segmentation:** Groups having comparable purchase behavior with similar characteristics. The group's respond to similar marketing activity. Customers are segmented based on characteristics like income, age and gender. Segmentation is divided into two groups based on whether marketers are using consumer behavior data or not. If yes, they rely mainly on demographic and geographic customer data.e,g : Age income, education level and others. Else they depend on : psychographic characteristics. For example, some customers have a better planned buying behavior, while others more impulsive.

**Targeting:** Targeting involves evaluating the potential profits from each segment and deciding which segments to focus on. But targeting activities are often focused on the qualitative examination of the consumer's perceptions.They involve psychology and usually budget constraints.Hence its not a part of customer analytics.

**Postioning:** Which segments to target --> its positioning.

- Or more like what products can be offered to them that would have the characteristics closest to the ones they need?
